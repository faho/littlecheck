Failure in python_multipe_error_annotation_lines.py:

  The CHECK on line 24 wants:
    things should be cool

  which failed to match line stdout:2:
    something failed

  additional output on stderr:3:5:
    stderr3
    stderr4
    stderr5

  Context:
    fine so far
    something failed <= does not match 'things should be cool'
    now stdout is broken (nothing to match)

  when running command:
    /usr/bin/python python_multipe_error_annotation_lines.py
